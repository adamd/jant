Jant: A build system for Java 8
-------------------------------

Yes, yet another build system.

Inspired by all those that come before: Ant, Maven, and Gradle.

Usage:

* First run ./install.sh
* Modify jant.sh if necessary.
* Modify Build.java for your build.
* Run ./jant.sh [task] to run the build
